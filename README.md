- **Google Cloud Run**: Container orchestration for ML service
- **Google Artifact Registry**: Storage for Docker container images
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database service

## üîÑ System Workflow

The platform operates on a sophisticated workflow that spans multiple services:

1. **User Registration & Authentication:**
   - User submits credentials via frontend form
   - Backend validates input, hashes passwords with bcrypt
   - JWT token generated and returned to browser
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage for session persistence

2. **Content Discovery & Interaction:**
   - Frontend fetches movie/series data from TMDB via backend proxy
   - User browses content with dynamic filtering options
   - Content details page displays comprehensive information and streaming options
   - User can "like" content, triggering background recommendation processes

3. **Recommendation Pipeline:** 
   - User likes content (movie/series)
   - Frontend sends authenticated like request to Node.js API
   - Backend stores preference in MongoDB and triggers ML service (asynchronously)
   - ML service awakens (Cold Start in Cloud Run if inactive)
   - ML service retrieves user's liked content history
   - Service fetches full content details from TMDB API
   - Text features extracted and processed with TF-IDF
   - Cosine similarity calculated between liked content and candidate pool
   - Top N recommendations identified and saved to user's MongoDB document
   - Process completes independently of user's current session

4. **Recommendation Display:**
   - User navigates to recommendations page
   - Backend fetches pre-calculated recommendation IDs from MongoDB
   - Backend enriches IDs with full content details from TMDB
   - Frontend renders personalized content cards
   - User discovers new content aligned with their taste profile

## üöÄ ML Recommendation System In Depth

### Content-Based Filtering Approach

The recommendation engine employs sophisticated content-based filtering techniques to analyze movie attributes and identify similarities:

### Feature Engineering

The system analyzes multiple content attributes:

- **Title**: Captures naming patterns and themes
- **Overview**: Identifies plot elements and storylines
- **Genres**: Categorizes content by type
- **Keywords**: Captures specific themes and elements

### Performance Optimization

- **Pre-calculation Strategy**: Recommendations computed asynchronously and stored
- **Batch Processing**: Updates triggered after preference changes, not real-time
- **Incremental Updates**: Algorithm designed to incorporate new likes efficiently

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud Platform Integration Deep Dive

### Why Google Cloud Run?

After encountering Vercel's serverless function limitations (250MB package size limit), I selected Google Cloud Run for the ML service based on:

- **Container-Native Architecture**: Freedom to use any dependencies without size constraints
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scales to zero when inactive for cost efficiency
- **On-Demand Processing**: Awakens only when needed for recommendation generation
- **Flexible Resource Allocation**: Configurable CPU and memory allocation for ML workloads
- **Integrated Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities

### GCP Implementation Details

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Created dedicated GCP project
   - Enabled Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Build APIs
   - Configured billing and permissions

2. **Containerization**:
   - Developed a multi-stage Dockerfile optimizing for size and security
   - Used Python 3.12 slim base image
   - Implemented proper dependency management
   - Configured Gunicorn as the WSGI server

3. **Cloud Build Pipeline**:
   - Automated container build process
   - Integrated vulnerability scanning
   - Pushed image to Artifact Registry

4. **Cloud Run Configuration**:
   - Deployed with memory optimization (2GB)
   - Configured concurrency settings for ML workloads
   - Implemented environment variable management for secrets
   - Set appropriate timeout parameters (60s)

5. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Securely stored MongoDB connection string
   - Managed TMDB API key access
   - Configured service-to-service authentication

## üîç Technical Challenges & Engineering Solutions

### 1. Serverless Function Size Limitations

**Challenge**: The ML service with scikit-learn and pandas exceeded Vercel's 250MB package size limit.

**Solution**: Containerized the Python application and deployed it on Google Cloud Run, which supports unlimited dependency sizes. This required:
- Creating a multi-stage Dockerfile to optimize image size
- Setting up Google Artifact Registry for container storage
- Configuring Cloud Run for efficient resource allocation
- Implementing proper cold start handling

### 2. Asynchronous Processing Coordination

**Challenge**: Vercel serverless functions timed out (~10s limit) while waiting for ML processing (~19s with cold starts).

**Solution**: Implemented an advanced **fire-and-forget pattern**:
- Backend sends non-blocking HTTP request to ML service
- Request includes authentication token and user ID
- ML service processes independently of API response cycle
- Recommendations stored in database for future retrieval
- Added comprehensive logging for asynchronous debugging

### 3. Cross-Service Authentication & Security

**Challenge**: Securing communication between Node.js API and Python ML service across different cloud providers.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented JWT-based service-to-service authentication
- Added request validation checking origin and timestamp
- Stored shared secrets in environment variables
- Applied rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implemented IP allowlisting for additional security

### 4. Data Consistency Across Services

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistent user preference data across browser storage, Node.js API, and ML service.

**Solution**:
- Migrated from browser localStorage to MongoDB for preference storage
- Implemented MongoDB change streams for real-time updates
- Added transaction support for critical operations
- Created robust error handling with retry mechanisms
- Designed data validation at multiple layers

### 5. Cold Start Latency Management

**Challenge**: Google Cloud Run's cold starts introduced significant latency for recommendation generation.

**Solution**:
- Implemented separate endpoints for synchronous vs. asynchronous operations
- Created a clever "pre-warming" strategy during predictable high-traffic periods
- Optimized container startup time by minimizing dependencies
- Added caching layer for frequently accessed TMDB data
- Implemented progressive loading UI patterns to handle latency gracefully

### 6. MongoDB Connection Management

**Challenge**: Managing database connections efficiently across serverless function invocations.

**Solution**:
- Implemented connection pooling with automatic retry logic
- Created efficient indexes for recommendation and user queries
- Utilized MongoDB aggregation pipeline for complex operations
- Designed database schema for optimal query performance
- Implemented proper connection cleanup to prevent leaks
